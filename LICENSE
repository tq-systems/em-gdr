ยง2 Warranty; Liability
  1. We expressly point out that it is not possible according to the
     state of the art to develop more complex software in such a way
     that an error-free function is guaranteed under all application
     conditions. We therefore only guarantee that the delivered software
     is suitable for contractual use in accordance with the description
     created or accepted by us.
  2. In the event of major, significant and reproducible deviations of the
     software functionality from the product description or specification, we
     are entitled, at our discretion, either to refund the purchase price paid
     by you or to carry out subsequent performance in the form of a new
     delivery or repair of the product, within a reasonable period of time.
     If, within the framework of the supplementary performance chosen by us,
     we are unable to eliminate the considerable deviations in the
     functionality of the software that have occurred within a reasonable
     period by providing a defect-free update or upgrade of the software or to
     circumvent them in such a way that you are able to use the software in
     accordance with the contract, you may claim a reduction in the agreed
     remuneration or withdraw from the contract. Any further claims are
     excluded to the extent permitted by law.
  3. We do not warrant for minor deviations in the functionality of the
     software from the product description or specification.
  4. The warranty period is one (1) year, unless longer periods are
     required by law. It begins with the acceptance of the software by
     you or - if a formal acceptance is not planned or does not take
     place - at the latest two (2) weeks after delivery or actual transfer.
  5. We do not warrant or assume any liability beyond the scope of use
     described in paragraph 1 with respect to the proper selection,
     application and use of the Software. This applies in particular to
     improper use, in particular the use of incompatible hardware or
     software, modifications or extensions to the software made
     independently by or at your instigation, the culpable omission of
     regular data backup and other cases of incorrect or negligent
     handling by you.
  6. If you use the software outside these license terms, all warranty
     and liability claims are void. The aforementioned warranty or
     liability limitations shall not apply in cases of injury to life,
     limb or health, in cases of liability falling within the scope of
     the Product Liability Act, insofar as the software lacks a property
     or quality expressly warranted by us or we are at fault in the form
     of intent or gross negligence.
